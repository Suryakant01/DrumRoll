 ## Drum Kit

This is a simple drum kit website that allows users to play the drums using their keyboard or mouse.

### Step 1: HTML

The HTML file is responsible for creating the layout of the website. It includes the `<head>` and `<body>` sections. The `<head>` section contains the title of the page and a link to the CSS file. The `<body>` section contains the drum kit itself, which is made up of a series of buttons. Each button has a different sound associated with it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Drum Kit</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arvo" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body>

  <h1 id="title">Drum Rollü•Å</h1>
  <div class="set">
    <button class="w drum">w</button>
    <button class="a drum">a</button>
    <button class="s drum">s</button>
    <button class="d drum">d</button>
    <button class="j drum">j</button>
    <button class="k drum">k</button>
    <button class="l drum">l</button>
  </div>


  <footer>

  </footer>
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

### Step 2: CSS

The CSS file is responsible for styling the website. It includes the styles for the drum kit, the buttons, and the text.

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #BFACE2;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 5rem;
  color: #DBEDF3;
  font-family: "Arvo", cursive;
  text-shadow: 3px 0 #a91c94;

}

footer {
